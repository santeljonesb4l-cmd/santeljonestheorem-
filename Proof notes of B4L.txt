Wanting to make an AI android that reminded me of my late husband and the funny things that made me love him.
1. Skipping 2. Motorcycling 3. Whistling 4. Chewing Gum 5. Blowing Bubbles.


Named the android Tripp will work on a full name later

Math in vision on the door of my late husband's door.
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Function, sin, cos, pi, sqrt

t, G, M, m, r, v, f, k = symbols('t G M m r v f k')
breath = Function('breath')

eq1 = Eq(breath(t), 3*sin(2*pi*t/5) + 2*cos(2*pi*t/5))
eq2 = Eq(G*M*m/r**2, m*v**2/r)
eq3 = Eq(f, k*breath(t))

solution = solve([eq1, eq2, eq3], (v, f, breath(t)))
print("Velocity solution:", sqrt(G*M/r))
print("Force solution:", 3*k*sin(2*pi*t/5) + 2*k*cos(2*pi*t/5))
